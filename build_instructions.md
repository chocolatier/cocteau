# Build Instructions 

## Rover

First, build the DFRobot Pirate according to the instructions [here](https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Pirate_4WD_Mobile_Platform_SKU:ROB0003). Disregard the instruction manual that came with the kit. The above wiki is a lot more detailed, and also has guide on wiring.  

Before you attach the 2nd plate, wire the additional sensors and servos to the Romeo Microcontroller. 

### Mini Pan-and-Tilt Hat 

Attach the Pan Wire to Digital Input 8

Attach the Tilt Wire to Digital Input 7


### Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F 

Plug the 3 Pin Cable in first. Then wire the live (red wire) to 5V, the ground (black wire) to GND and the analog (white wire) to A0. 

### DFRobot 10cm infrared sensor

Attach it to one of the three pin Digital Input Sets - I have used 2.
